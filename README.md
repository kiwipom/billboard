# What are you doing with your time?

This is a app I started building on a Sunday as a social experiment - I had grand plans to stream my desktop and let people watch and get involved. Unfortunately technical difficulties prevented that, so it ended up being a quiet day coding.

I got a bunch of work done in the end, but I'm sticking to screenshots until I can restyle some of the controls to fit better with the theme.

### Features/Goals
 - keep it simple, stupid
 - provide feedback to the user and identify trends
 - introduce some of the lean/kanban concepts in reporting (continuous flow diagrams? burn down charts?)
 - adapt to the available screen

### Implemented
 
 - fetching data from sqlite
 - basic data entry form to add tasks
 - visual cues for tasks with a target date and large tasks
 - tutorial done as tasks on the board

### What's Next?
 
 - restyling the default controls 
 - font sizes - experiment as they don't feel right across different screen resolutions
 - implement editing an existing task
 - drag and drop tasks between buckets
 - reorder tasks in a bucket
 - share target - receive a URL/tweet/text/something and turn it into a new task
 - resolve bug with Telerik RadDatePicker - http://www.telerik.com/community/forums/metro/datepicker-xaml/binding-errors-with-pickers.aspx

### Other Cool Things I could add:

 - Toast/Tile notifications - use for task reminders
 - Introduce Portable Tools project to reuse code elsewhere (WP7/8)
 - Dogfood the Telerik Metro controls - Date Picker, Charts, sliders etc
 - syncing data between devices
 - testing these components
 - Sync with Trello
 - Sync with Remember the Milk
